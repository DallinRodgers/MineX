## Description

The is an online game for mining in space. On the homepage there are two options. Build a new ship or find your ship. If they choose to build a ship they will be given a form to fill out.
This form validates their input and encrypts the password when everything is entered correctly. After this they are taken to the game page. This page is still in progress.
The game does shave their progress so if they choose to sign in it will display their current progress.

## My Work

This project was from a group assingment in my Full Stack Bootcamp through the University of Utah. Everthing you see here was my contribution to the assignment except for the game dashboard and imgs. 

I setup the express handlebars, api and html routes, page styling, password encryption, and sequelize batabase.
