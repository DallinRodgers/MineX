## Description

The is an online game for mining in space. On the homepage there are two options. Build a new ship or find your ship. If they choose to build a ship they will be given a form to fill out.
This form validates their input and encrypts the password when everything is entered correctly. After this they are taken to the game page. 

This page is still in progress.
The game is intended to save their progress so if they choose to sign in it will display their current progress.

## My Work

This project was from a group assignment in my Full Stack Bootcamp through the University of Utah. My contribution to the assignment was the login page and login functionality. 

Setup the express handlebars, api and html routes, page styling, password encryption, and sequelize batabase.
